# Error Handling

We recommend that your code raise exceptions for conditions where it cannot
gracefully recover. Additionally, we recommend that you have a reasonable PHP
`error_reporting` setting that includes warnings and fatal errors:

```php
error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT & ~E_NOTICE);
```

If you follow these guidelines, you can then write or use middleware that does
the following:

- sets an error handler that converts PHP errors to `ErrorException` instances.
- wraps execution of the handler (`$handler->handle()`) with a try/catch block.

As an example:

```php
function (ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler) : ResponseInterface
{
    set_error_handler(function ($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline) {
        if (! (error_reporting() & $errno)) {
            // Error is not in mask
            return;
        }
        throw new ErrorException($errstr, 0, $errno, $errfile, $errline);
    });

    try {
        $response = $handler->handle($request);
        return $response;
    } catch (Throwable $e) {
    }

    restore_error_handler();

    $response = new TextResponse(sprintf(
        "[%d] %s\n\n%s",
        $e->getCode(),
        $e->getMessage(),
        $e->getTraceAsString()
    ), 500);
}
```

You would then pipe this as the outermost (or close to outermost) layer of your
application:

```php
$app->pipe($errorMiddleware);
```

## There is an easier way

So that you do not need to do this, we provide an error handler for you, via
laminas-stratigility: `Laminas\Stratigility\Middleware\ErrorHandler`.

This implementation allows you to both:

- provide a response generator, invoked when an error is caught; and
- register listeners to trigger when errors are caught.

We provide the factory `Mezzio\Container\ErrorHandlerFactory` for
generating the instance; it should be mapped to the service
`Laminas\Stratigility\Middleware\ErrorHandler`.

We provide two error response generators for you:

- `Mezzio\Middleware\ErrorResponseGenerator`, which optionally will
  accept a `Mezzio\Template\TemplateRendererInterface` instance, and a
  template name. When present, these will be used to generate response content;
  otherwise, a plain text response is generated that notes the request method
  and URI.

  Since version 3.1.0, it also accepts a layout name, if you want to use one
  other than `layout::default`.

- `Mezzio\Middleware\WhoopsErrorResponseGenerator`, which uses
  [whoops](http://filp.github.io/whoops/) to present detailed exception
  and request information; this implementation is intended for development
  purposes.

Each also has an accompanying factory for generating the instance:

- `Mezzio\Container\ErrorResponseGeneratorFactory`
- `Mezzio\Container\WhoopsErrorResponseGeneratorFactory`

Map the service `Mezzio\Middleware\ErrorResponseGenerator` to one of
these two factories in your configuration:

```php
use Laminas\Stratigility\Middleware\ErrorHandler;
use Mezzio\Container;
use Mezzio\Middleware;

return [
    'dependencies' => [
        'factories' => [
            ErrorHandler::class => Container\ErrorHandlerFactory::class,
            Middleware\ErrorResponseGenerator::class => Container\ErrorResponseGeneratorFactory::class,
        ],
    ],
];
```

> ### Use development mode configuration to enable whoops
>
> You can specify the above in one of your `config/autoload/*.global.php` files,
> to ensure you have a production-capable error response generator.
>
> If you are using [laminas-development-mode](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-development-mode)
> in your application (which is provided by default in the skeleton
> application), you can toggle usage of whoops by adding configuration to the file
> `config/autoload/development.local.php.dist`:
>
> ```php
> use Mezzio\Container;
> use Mezzio\Middleware;
>
> return [
>     'dependencies' => [
>         'factories' => [
>             Middleware\WhoopsErrorResponseGenerator::class => Container\WhoopsErrorResponseGeneratorFactory::class,
>         ],
>     ],
> ];
> ```
>
> When you enable development mode, whoops will then be enabled; when you
> disable development mode, you'll be using your production generator.
>
> If you are not using laminas-development-mode, you can define a
> `config/autoload/*.local.php` file with the above configuration whenever you
> want to enable whoops.

## Listening for errors

When errors occur, you may want to _listen_ for them in order to provide
features such as logging. `Laminas\Stratigility\Middleware\ErrorHandler` provides
the ability to do so via its `attachListener()` method.

This method accepts a callable with the following signature:

```php
function (
    Throwable $error,
    ServerRequestInterface $request,
    ResponseInterface $response
) : void
```

The response provided is the response returned by your error response generator,
allowing the listener the ability to introspect the generated response as well.

As an example, you could create a logging listener as follows:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Acme;

use Exception;
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Throwable;

class LoggingErrorListener
{
    /**
     * Log format for messages:
     *
     * STATUS [METHOD] path: message
     */
    const LOG_FORMAT = '%d [%s] %s: %s';

    private $logger;

    public function __construct(LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this->logger = $logger;
    }

    public function __invoke(Throwable $error, ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response)
    {
        $this->logger->error(sprintf(
            self::LOG_FORMAT,
            $response->getStatusCode(),
            $request->getMethod(),
            (string) $request->getUri(),
            $error->getMessage()
        ));
    }
}
```

You could then use a [delegator factory](container/delegator-factories.md) to
create your logger listener and attach it to your error handler:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Acme;

use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
use Laminas\Stratigility\Middleware\ErrorHandler;

class LoggingErrorListenerDelegatorFactory
{
    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container, string $name, callable $callback) : ErrorHandler
    {
        $listener = new LoggingErrorListener($container->get(LoggerInterface::class));
        $errorHandler = $callback();
        $errorHandler->attachListener($listener);
        return $errorHandler;
    }
}
```

Then, enable the delegator factory in your application, such as by adding the following to the `getDependencies()` function in your app or moduleâ€™s _ConfigProvider.php_ file.

```php
'delegators' => [
    ErrorHandler::class => [
        LoggingErrorListenerDelegatorFactory::class,
    ]
],
```

## Handling more specific error types

You could also write more specific error handlers. As an example, you might want
to catch `UnauthorizedException` instances specifically, and display a login
page:

```php
function (ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler) use ($renderer) : ResponseInterface
{
    try {
        $response = $handler->handle($request);
        return $response;
    } catch (UnauthorizedException $e) {
    }

    return new HtmlResponse(
        $renderer->render('error::unauthorized'),
        401
    );
}
```

You could then push this into a middleware pipe only when it's needed:

```php
$app->get('/dashboard', [
    $unauthorizedHandlerMiddleware,
    $middlewareThatChecksForAuthorization,
    $middlewareBehindAuthorizationWall,
], 'dashboard');
```

## Page not found

Error handlers work at the outermost layer, and are used to catch exceptions and
errors in your application. At the _innermost_ layer of your application, you
should ensure you have middleware that is _guaranteed_ to return a response;
this prevents errors in your application in the event that the application
exhausts the middleware queue.

This in turn allows you to fully craft what sort of response is returned in such
conditions.

Generally speaking, reaching the innermost middleware layer indicates that no
middleware was capable of handling the request, and thus an HTTP 404 Not Found
condition.

To simplify such responses, we provide
`Mezzio\Handler\NotFoundHandler`.  It will report a 404 response,
optionally using a composed template renderer to do so.

We provide a factory, `Mezzio\Container\NotFoundHandlerFactory`, for
creating an instance, which we [detail elsewhere](container/factories.md#notfoundhandlerfactory). You should pipe it as the innermost layer of your application:

```php
// A basic application:
$app->pipe(ErrorHandler::class);
// . . .
$app->pipe(RouteMiddleware::class);
// . . .
$app->pipe(DispatchMiddleware::class);
$app->pipe(NotFoundHandler::class);
```

If you wish to provide an alternate response status or use a canned response,
you should provide your own handler and pipe it to your application.
